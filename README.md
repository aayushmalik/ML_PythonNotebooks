### My Machine Learning Workflow

- Import Libraries
- Import Data
- Look at top 10 values to see how data looks like
- Data Frame Profiling
    - Looking at shape
    - Talk to domain expert
    - Count NA values in each column and replacing them if needed
    - Data cleaning
    - Describing numerical variables
    - Checking for outliers using boxplots and removing them
- Machine Learning
    - Correlation Heatmap
    - Feature Engineering (https://towardsdatascience.com/feature-selection-techniques-in-machine-learning-with-python-f24e7da3f36e)
    - Checking assumptions of the model, thinking about parameters
    - Applying ML algorithm
    - Drawing real and predicted outputs for graphical understanding
    - Improving the model and sharing outputs
